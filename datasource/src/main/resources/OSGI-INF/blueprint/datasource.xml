    This defines the actual data source bean.  It will instantiate a new ClientXADataSource instance and will use the
    corresponding settings to set the database and server name.  In our case, we will be running Apache Derby on the same
    machine so the server name is `localhost`.  A database called `transactions` has been created up-front as well.

    We're publishing our data source into the OSGi Service Registry as a `XADataSource`.  This will allow Aries JTA
    to automatically enlist this resource as an XA-aware resource.

    We also assign the `osgi.jndi.service.name` property to give us an easy-to-use JNDI name to lookup this data source
    from our JPA persistence.xml in the `database` module afterwards.
